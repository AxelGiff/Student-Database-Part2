# Student-Database-Part2
Script and SQL file from the FreeCodeCamp course named "Learn SQL by Building a Student Database: Part 2".

During my learning on freecodecamp, I was able to carry out an SQL project to create a relationnal database with multiples tables and a script that gives information about a student database. It includes conditions like "WHERE", "OR", "AND", etc.. 
The script also contains some informations about to join 2+ tables with "JOIN", and it can also be used to target certain characters.
